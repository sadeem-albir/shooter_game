# Basic Test for a Game
Hey guys, so this is a basic small project I've worked on for
the past few days, and having gone the furthest I have with this project than any other before, I think I can say I'm proud of what I've done so far. Anyway, here's a quick guide on how to play:

Mouse button enables mouse-mode, keyboard button enables right and left arrow-keys.
SPACE to shoot.
If you're on mouse-mode, you right-click to shoot but you still can use SPACE-BAR, just not arrow-keys.
The 4 blue buttons on the right do exactly what they say, but just for clarification, the "cool down+"
increases the amount of time it takes to reload.
Kills shows how many enemies you've killed, and Enemies shows how many enemies are currently on the screen.

The main file to run is main.py, but all other files are essential for it to work. Also, you need pygame and its dependencies.

I know there is a lot yet to improve, but I just got started learning to program very recently, so if there's
any suggestions you think would help with this small project, let me know because I'm open to improvement and growth :D
